= How does it work =
Every time a user/bot sends a comment in a specific post or page Spam Protection checks if that specific user/bot have visited for at least x seconds that specific post or page.

If that user/bot has not visited that post for at least x seconds the user/bot receives the message "You are posting the comment too quickly. Slow down."

You can browse all the blocked comments under the Spam Protection menu voice, so that you can actually check how many comments this plugin has blocked.


= Options =
1. Time Delay - The user/bot has to wait this time before posting a comment.
2. Maximum Time Limit - The user/bot has a maximum time limit within which he has to post a comment.
3. Custom Message - This is the message displayed to a blocked user/bot.
